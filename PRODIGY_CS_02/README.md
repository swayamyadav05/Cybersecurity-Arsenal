# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

This project demonstrates a basic image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation in Python.

## How It Works

The tool manipulates the RGB values of each pixel in the image by applying a mathematical operation (e.g., adding a key to each pixel value). It then reverses the operation to decrypt the image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library (for image processing)

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
